Please take note that what I am telling you is in the context of UNIX/ Linux 

For ICS 45C go to project directory using cd (dir in DOS) 
use ./build to compile
use ./run to run

./somefile means execute some file as a program (note you must have execute permisssions on the file and its directory 
on the Operating System in order to do thiss

to take input from a file instead of the command line prompt use

./run < Inputfile
in this context 
./run < input/proj1sample.txt

to redirect output

./run > outfile

can use both as well

./run <Inputfile >outfile
